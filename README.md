### Structure fault-tolerance of the augmented cube


`abstract`:The augmented cube, denoted by AQ_n , is an important variant of the hypercube. It retains many favorable properties of the hypercube and possesses several embeddable properties that the hypercube and its other variations do not possess. Connectivity is one of the most important indicators used to evaluate a networkâ€™s fault tolerance performance. Structure and substructure connectivity are the two novel generalizations of the connectivity, which provide a new way to evaluate fault-tolerant ability of a network. .
