### Structure fault-tolerance of the augmented cube


`abstract`:  The augmented cube, denoted by AQ_n , is an important variant of the hypercube. It retains many favorable properties of the hypercube and possesses several embeddable properties that the hypercube and its other variations do not possess. Connectivity is one of the most important indicators used to evaluate a networkâ€™s fault tolerance performance. Structure and substructure connectivity are the two novel generalizations of the connectivity, which provide a new way to evaluate fault-tolerant ability of a network. .

### The Communication Performance of BCDC Data Center Network

`abstract`:  The BCDC network is a new server-centric data center network based on crossed cube. Its decentralized and recursively defined features solve the bandwidth bottleneck problem of the upper switch in the tree structure and make it more scalable. In addition, the degree of BCDC server is constant, which reduces connection cost and technical difficulty relative to DCell and BCube. In this paper, we study and analyze the data communication, fault tolerance, and node-disjoint paths of BCDC through practical experiments. The results show that BCDC is superior to DCell and Fat-Tree in data communication. Moreover, in terms of fault-tolerant routing and node-disjoint paths, the performance of BCDC is no worse than that of DCell and FatTree. We also propose a one-to-one communication algorithm in BCDC under 1-restricted connectivity, analyze time complexity of algorithm, and give an upper bound of the conditional faulty diameter of BCDC under 1-restricted connectivity. The work in this paper provides an important basis for the design and application of the new data center network.

### The 3-extra conditional diagnosability of Augmented cubes

`abstract`:  Diagnosis is an important indicator to measure the fault tolerance and reliability of the network. Diagnosis is the process of identifying faulty nodes in the network. The stronger the diagnosis ability, the faster the fault nodes in the network are found, and the more stable the network is. The maximum number of faulty nodes that a network can detect is called the diagnosability of the network. Therefore, the fault diagnosis ability is one of the important indicators to measure the reliability of the network. Therefore, in this paper, we hope to study the 3-additional connectivity diagnosis degree of the extended cube and give the corresponding diagnosis algorithm.
