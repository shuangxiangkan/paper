Firstly,Briefly talk about the role of the network in distributed and parallel system, 
then explain connectivity and its importance in assessing network stability and fault tolerance of network. 
Futhermore,introduce the shortcomings of this connectivity in evaluating network stability
and propose several kinds of connectivity variants to make up for the shortcomings, 
with emphasis on extra connectivity, because this connectivity will be used in subsequent papers.
Then, introduce the structural connectivity and augmented cube that will be demonstrated in this paper.
Finally, the structure of the paper is explained.
